\p\r
When you get assigned your first case, you might feel a little weird as you get transported to the Human Realm; don't worry about that too much, the feeling will pass
\p\r
These children that we try to help, they all have their own issues that impact their moral compass.
\p\r
The actions of others have had a severe negative impact on their ability to process the world around them.
\p\r
We basically take control of their decision making centers so we can show them how to be proper.
\p\r
Ahh, here we are, this is the case simulator. Here you will begin your training.
\p\r
This here is Terry, he is a very troubled child, and it is your job to help them.
\p\r
Whenever they have to make a decision you will be presented with 2 choices: one \B\I\C(#1dc21d)GOOD\i\b\c and one \B\I\C(#980000)BAD\b\i\c. It will be your responsibility to pick the right choice in each scenario.
\p\r
